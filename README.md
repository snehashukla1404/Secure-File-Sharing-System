# Secure File Sharing System

A Python-based secure file sharing system that enables encrypted communication between a client and server. This project demonstrates the implementation of secure file transfer protocols using cryptographic techniques.

## ✨ Features
- Secure file transfer between client and server
- Encryption and decryption of files
- Simple command-line interface for ease of use

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** socket, cryptography

## 📂 Project Structure

- client.py          # Client-side application
- server.py          # Server-side application
- README.md          # Project documentation (this file)


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed

### Installation
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/snehashukla1404/Secure-File-Sharing-System.git
  cd Secure-File-Sharing-System
  ```
- Install any required dependencies if needed (e.g., cryptography):
  ```bash
  pip install cryptography
  ```
  
## 🚀 Running the Application

### Step 1: Start the Server
To begin, you'll need to start the server to listen for incoming file transfer requests.
- Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory if you're not already there:
   ```bash
   cd Secure-File-Sharing-System
   ```
  Run the server script:
  ```bash
  python server.py
  ```
- Start the Client
  Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project directory (if not already there):
  ```bash
  cd Secure-File-Sharing-System
  ```
  Run the client script:
  ```bash
  python client.py
  ```
- File Transfer
- Check the File on the Server

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Implement user authentication for secure access
- Add support for multiple file transfers
- Enhance error handling and user interface
